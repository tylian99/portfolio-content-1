      <br><h2>Introduction to Splatoon series</h2><br>
      <br><p>Splatoon is a third-person shooter video game franchise created by Hisashi Nogami, and developed and owned by Nintendo. Set in a post-apocalyptic Earth inhabited by anthropomorphic marine animals, the series centers around fictional cephalopods known as Inklings and Octolings - based on squids and octopuses respectively - which can transform between humanoid and cephalopod forms at will. They frequently engage in turf war battles with each other and use a variety of weapons that produce and shoot colored ink while in humanoid form, or swim and hide in surfaces covered in their own-colored ink while in their cephalopodic forms.
The first game in the series, Splatoon, was released for the Wii U in May 2015. A sequel, Splatoon 2, was released for the Nintendo Switch in July 2017, followed by an expansion pack, Octo Expansion, in June 2018. The series has received positive reviews for its style, gameplay mechanics and soundtrack, with both games in the series having been nominated and awarded several year-end accolades from various gaming publications. The series has sold over 18 million copies. A third game, Splatoon 3, was released on 9 September 2022.
Splatoon has spawned numerous collaborations with third-party companies and established its own esports tournament circuit in 2018. It has spawned a manga series as well as holographic music concerts in Japan.</p>
<p><br>Following the Team Chaos victory in the Chaos vs. Order Splatfest, Splatoon 3's style is very chaotic, bringing post-apocalyptic, patchwork, and other chaotic elements together with the styles of both previous games.

  Splatoon 3 expands the Splatoon series on many different fronts, with an extensive story mode and lore, new Salmon Run challenges and rewards, a wider range of customisation with more options and the addition of Splashtags, and the newly-added locker room. Additionally, Splatoon 3 streamlines many aspects of the previous games. The lobby has been reworked into a greatly-expanded practice area accessible between matches, Splatfests are overhauled for three teams with a new Tricolor Turf War mode, and the UI has been made much more responsive and informative.</p>
